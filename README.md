# PyTorch-Custom-Datasets

Practice creating custom datasets for use in machine learning applications using PyTorch. 

Two methods employed:

- Use pre-existing dataset class from PyTorch (ImageFolder)
- Create a custom dataloader class

These datasets were used to train a CNN and predict food type from image data, using truncated data from the Food101 dataset.
